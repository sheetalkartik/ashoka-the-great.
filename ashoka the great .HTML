<html>Ashoka the Great, was an Indian emperor of the Maurya Dynasty, who ruled almost all of the Indian subcontinent from c.â€‰268 to 232 BCE.[6][7] A grandson of the dynasty's founder Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia.[4] Considered by many to be one of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire to reign over a realm stretching from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala. The empire's capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain.

Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha),[8] which he conquered in about 260 BCE.[9] According to an interpretation of his Edicts, he converted to Buddhism[8] after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War, which he had waged out of a desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations.[10] He is remembered for erecting the Ashoka pillars and spreading his Edicts,[11] for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia,[4] and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha.
